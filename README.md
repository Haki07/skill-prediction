# Yunfei's fork of skill prediction

This version of SP will handle racial differences instead of elin only.

Update Nov 23, Gunner Burst fire -5 willpower cost armor roll support. Priest Mana charge +15% charge speed armor roll support

Update Nov 22, 2017: Point blank, blocks button spam and invalid skill casts, and becomes slow, it was not supposed to be that fast.


Soonâ„¢: Double casts prevention(Short skills like Teleporting jaunts, Overpower, Restraning arrow, Web arrow)

Reading exact length and distance data from tera data center (Boring af)
